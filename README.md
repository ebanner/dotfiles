## Keyboard layout

Probably the most unorthodox configuration I perform is modifying my keyboard layout (configuration in [`/karabiner`](karabiner)).

This layout is optimized to decrease the amount of typing done by the pinkies. It takes all the most frequently pressed keys by the pinkies (i.e. `Control`, `Alt`, `Enter`, and `Tab`) and puts them in the top row. This allows these keys to be pressed by the ring, middle, and index fingers.

I made this layout because I was getting pinky fatigue when using jupyter notebooks (hitting `Shift-Enter` a lot) and also emacs (hitting `Control` and `Alt`) a lot. I have been using this variants of this layout for over a year now and find it very enjoyable.
