## Wide Dvorak

The most interesing thing here is probably my modified dvorak layout.

### Notable features

* The letters from the dvorak layout remain almost completely untouched. Thus
  you still get the complete dvorak experience with almost no learning curve.

* Right Shift and Enter are now accesible with the right pinky without having to
  turn the right hand at an uncomfortable angle. This was my major source of
  pain while typing.

* " remains reachable with the left hand so common contractions (e.g. I'm, it's,
  can't, you're, etc.) are still typed smoothly with the left then right hand.

* BackSpace, and \ are now typed with the left hand, cutting down on the right
  handed lopsidedness you get with dvorak.

* Since the right hand rests one more column to the right, the keyboard has a
  more symmetrical feel and the wrists are more straightened.

* The braces are in a more convenient location. Coupled with Caps Lock becoming
  another Control modifier, this makes hitting &lt;C-\[&gt; a snap in vim.

I drew inspiration from the Programmer Dvorak layout and some of the
modifications from DreymaR on the [Colemak
forums](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=12302). As you can probably
tell, my biggest motivation for making these changes came from excess strain on
the right wrist by hitting the leftmost keys on the keyboard.
