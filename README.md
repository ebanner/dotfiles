Dotfiles
========

Configuration for the following \*nix utilities:

* xmodmap (Wide dvorak)
* X11
* Bash and zsh shells
* dwm statusbar
* feh
* git
* vim

The most interesing thing here is probably my modified dvorak layout.

![Wide Dvorak](https://raw.github.com/ebanner/dotfiles/master/Wide_Dvorak.png "Wide Dvorak")

The inspiration came from DreymaR on the [Colemak
forums](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=12302). Basically my right
wrist was hurting because of how I had to turn my right wrist to reach Right
Shift and Enter. Now they're perfectly reachable with the right pinky without
even moving my right hand!

You get a nice straightening out of the wrists, too. I also found BackSpace
painful to reach, so I swapped it with BackSpace. I find BackSpace on the left
side more natural anyway.

One of the greatest things I've done is turn Caps Lock into a Control key. I
can't even keep track of how often I use it now. A very nice side effect is
scrolling up and down with &lt;C-u&gt; and &lt;C-d&gt; in vim.
